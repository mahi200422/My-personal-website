Challenges I faced while creating my portfolio:

One of the biggest challenges for me was adding the falling snow effect. It was my first time using it, so it took a while to figure out how to set it up properly.
I also struggled with choosing matching colors, especially when using gradients. Sometimes the two colors didn’t blend well together, so I had to keep changing them until they looked right.
Another challenge was with the project section — I had trouble getting the cards to flip correctly. It took a lot of trial and error to make them work the way I wanted.
